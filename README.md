# Spectral clustering for GPs

We borrow the net-win concept used in the work 'Clustering Using Pairwise Comparisons' proposed by R. Srikant and apply it to the
problem of extracting gradual patterns (GPs). In order to mine for GPs, each feature yields 2 gradual items which we use
to construct a ranking matrix that compares rows/objects to one another (i.e., (r1,r2), (r1,r3), (r1,r4), (r2,r3), (r2,r4),
(r3,r4)).

In this algorithm, we transform the object pairs to *net-win matrices*. Finally, we apply spectral clustering to
determine which gradual items belong to the same group based on the similarity of their object pairs. Gradual items in
the same cluster should have almost similar score vector. Every gradual pattern is inferred from a cluster of gradual items. <!-- The research paper is available via this link: -->

### Requirements:

You will be required to install the following python dependencies before using <em><strong>Clu-GRAD</strong></em> algorithm:<br>
```
                   install python (version => 3.6)

```
<!-- python-dateutil scikit-fuzzy cython h5py mpi4py -->
```
                    $ pip3 install so4gp~=0.1.9 numpy~=1.21.5 ypstruct~=0.0.2 scikit-learn~=1.0.2

```

### Usage:
Use it a command line program with the local package to mine gradual patterns:

For example we executed the <em><strong>Clu-GRAD</strong></em> algorithm on a sample data-set<br>
```
$python3 src/main.py -a 'clugrad' -f data/DATASET.csv
```

where you specify the input parameters as follows:<br>
* <strong>filename.csv</strong> - [required] a file in csv format <br>
* <strong>minSup</strong> - [optional] minimum support ```default = 0.5``` <br>


<strong>Output</strong><br>
```
1. Age
2. Salary
3. Cars
4. Expenses

File: ../data/DATASET.csv

Pattern : Support
[1-, 4+] : 1.0
[1+, 2+, 4-] : 0.6
